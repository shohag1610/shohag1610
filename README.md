# 🌟 Hi there, I'm Shohag Mia — Data Engineer & AI Developer 👋
I’m a passionate **Data Engineer** with strong skills in Python, SQL, AWS cloud services, infrastructure-as-code, and scalable data systems.  
I enjoy solving complex data problems, building automated pipelines, and developing backend systems that power analytics and machine learning.

With an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence**, I bring both engineering and machine learning experience to every project.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Building data pipelines and ETL workflows using Python, SQL, and AWS.
- Developing GPU-accelerated LLM chatbots using PyTorch + HuggingFace.
- Experimenting with data orchestration and real-time processing.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Data pipeline orchestration (Airflow / Step Functions)
- Advanced SQL optimisation & analytical query patterns
- Efficient LLM inference and fine-tuning techniques

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- ETL pipeline automation  
- Cloud-native data engineering projects  
- NLP / ML solutions integrated into production systems  
- Python-based workflow automation tools
